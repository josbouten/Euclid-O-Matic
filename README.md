This project is based on a project called 'Euclidean Rhythm Generator Kosmo/Eurorack' 
published by L J Brackney, (Suncoast Polytechnical High School)
dated 11/21/2021. It saw it on www.instructables.com and liked it so much that I decide to make my own version of the module.
While doing so I changed the hardware and the software (quite) a bit. Work on this started
in January 2022.

Amongst others I added support for:

    external clock in and clock out,
    4 function CV inputs,
    variable pattern length,
    patch storage and recall,
    recall of settings on startup,
    a reset input.

Using the F-1 â€¦ F-4 CV inputs the patterns can be shifted stepwise.

5th October 2023
Added mute buttons for the trigger channels, 
Switched off the pattern length menu (but kept it in the code
just in case) because I wasn't using it.
